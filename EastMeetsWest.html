    <h2>Respect in Fusion</h2>
    <p>East-meets-West fashion only thrives when built on respect, education, and acknowledgment. Gen Z has become increasingly aware of the difference between appreciation and appropriation. Appreciation involves crediting cultural sources, collaborating with artisans, understanding history, and giving back to communities. When done thoughtfully, cross-cultural inspiration celebrates origins while fearlessly creating something entirely new. The future belongs to fusion that respects heritage while innovating with integrity.</p>
